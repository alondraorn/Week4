## Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>This project is based off the website, WebMD. Users will be using this website to find information to attend to their medical needs. This website helps users understand what disease or illness they may have depending on their symptoms. It also tells them how they will be able to cure it. It also has news on health. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity allows users to tend to their health. Because it allows them to know what illness they have, it allows them to properly treat themselves. It gives them a peace of mind while also allowing them to improve their health. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Current solutions are scheduling a doctor’s appointment. However, this may take months in advance to see the proper doctor or get a secure appointment that works with the person’s lifestyle. Other solutions are getting medical advice from friends or taking cures or ointments that one’s parents would give them.

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>With digital technology, a person can tend to their medical needs immediately. If it was for something not so serious, then going onto a website that tells you how to treat your illness, would be extremely time efficient and cost effectively. You don’t need to have medical insurance or you would not need to clear up most of your time to simply do a search on a website. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 2: Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: The users of this website are all age and ethnic groups, minus people who aren’t old enough to know how to use the computer. At any age, anyone can get sick, thus this is applicable to everyone, it’s just a matter of fact whether they know how to read. 

>Preferences: users have the ability to obtain some of the items being recommended by the website, like over the counter drugs. 

>Expertise: You would need to know how to read to use this application

**Where would the users do that activity?**
>Users would use this application at home. This website can serve as a replacement for going to the doctors as it offers advice wherever and whenever. Thus, you do not need to be at a specific place to use it, you would just need somewhere that has internet connection. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>Users would need to know their symptoms in order to find out what disease or illness they are suffering from. They would need to know what hurts and how to type this into the website. As long as they know their symptoms, they will be able to look up what they have and how they can treat it.

## Reflection
The goal of this research is to gague how difficult it is to find medical advice, information or inquiries online. WebMD is a great resource for this as it offers a wide selection of medical advice, tips and resources. Thus, I wanted my user to look use this website and based on their reaction and comments, understand what areas this website needs improvement on. Thus, I made a survey about the website and I asked my user various questions that would allow me to understand whether it was difficult to find certain information. The survey also helped me understand the goal of this website and what people are looking for when they are on WebMD. This helps me restructure the website so that it prioritizes the user's
needs. The interview was about 14 minutes and I interviewed my sibling, Mellanda. She was at her house and I was in mine but we were able to conference call over Zoom. I explained to her that this interview is recorded and that she should not try to give me an answer that she thinks is right but an honest and genuine one. In this interview, I asked her background on how often she needs to see the doctor, why or not she would see a doctor and then seeped more into the medical advice online realm. Following, I asked her to do a task that was about looking up cures for her recent illness. Lastly, I asked for her feedback on the website and then a few more interest questions that related to the other features on the website. 

Doing this interview was extremely helpful. Her commentes helped me understand why people would use this website. She said she doesn't like going to the doctor's office because she "sometimes feel like they put me off or like disregard my symptoms". I think a strong feature about this website is that it offers medical advice for everything, thus making the user feel acknowledged. Thus, if I have to redesign the website, I would stress this feature. Another useful aspect about this interview was the feedback portion. When doing the assignment, she mentioned a very important feature that the website lacked. She mentioned that it didn't feel too reliable because there were no links to resources about the diseases. She wanted informative backstory about the informaiton. She also mentioned that there were a lack of pictures. If there were more pictures I think it would have helped her better navigate the page and spend 1-5 minutes on this tasks. Afterall, Mellanda mentioned previously that she only wished to spend that much time on a task like this. Another helpful comment from the feedback section was about the task. When looking up her symptoms, she mentioned that she didn't know how many symptoms she should report. I think this website lacks a great deal of instruction. I don't think that the user should be wondering things like this. She was also became confused when she saw too many results come up. I feel like if the website was more specific on what it wanted its users to do or the results it comes up with, it would have been an easier experience for Mellanda. Overall, this interview helped me understand that she wanted this website to feel more reliable and to have more set instructions. 

One thing that went wrong during this interview was the interviewee I interviewed. Due to cirucumstances, I was only able to interview my sibling, which allowed it to be a more relaxed interview. As a result, I was at times not able to maintain professionalism. Next time, I will try my best to avoid interviewing someone I know. Another area that I would like to improve on is to find a more difficult test to use when writing the interview. It was hard to find a task that would take more than 6 minutes of time to do. This is because things on this website are relatively straightfoward. However, next time I would like to look into this area more.
