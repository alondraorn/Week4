## Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>This project is based off the website, WebMD. Users will be using this website to find information to attend to their medical needs. This website helps users understand what disease or illness they may have depending on their symptoms. It also tells them how they will be able to cure it. It also has news on health. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity allows users to tend to their health. Because it allows them to know what illness they have, it allows them to properly treat themselves. It gives them a peace of mind while also allowing them to improve their health. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Current solutions are scheduling a doctor’s appointment. However, this may take months in advance to see the proper doctor or get a secure appointment that works with the person’s lifestyle. Other solutions are getting medical advice from friends or going off cures or ointments that one’s parents would give them.

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>With digital technology, a person can tend to their medical needs immediately. If it was for something not so serious, then going onto a website that tells you how to treat your illness, would be extremely time efficient and cost effectively. You don’t need to have medical insurance or you would not need to clear up most of your time to simply do a search on a website. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 2: Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: The users of this website are all age and ethnic groups, minus people who aren’t old enough to know how to use the computer. At any age, anyone can get sick, thus this is applicable to everyone, it’s just a matter of fact whether they know how to read. 

>Preferences: users have the ability to obtain some of the items being recommended by the website, like over the counter drugs. 

>Expertise: You would need to know how to read to use this application

**Where would the users do that activity?**
>Users would use this application at home. This website can serve as a replacement for going to the doctors as it offers advice wherever and whenever. Thus, you do not need to be at a specific place to use it, you would just need somewhere that has internet connection. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>Users would need to know their symptoms in order to find out what disease or illness they are suffering from. They would need to know what hurts and how to type this into the website. As long as they know their symptoms, they will be able to look up what they have and how they can treat it.
